# Bank Loan Data Analysis Project

## 1. Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze bank loan data, extract key insights, and present them using a Power BI dashboard. The analysis focuses on loan applications, funded amounts, payment records, interest rates, DTI (Debt-to-Income Ratio), and loan statuses. The final goal is to create a 3-page Power BI dashboard that summarizes the key findings and allows for detailed exploration of the data.

## 2. Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is detailed in the following document:

[Dataset Details](Dataset/Dataset_details.md)

This dataset contains information about various loan applications, including personal details, loan amount, payment history, loan status, and more.

## 3. Problem Statement
The problem statement for this project, including the requirements and business logic, can be found in this document:

[Problem Statement & Other Details](Problem_Statement_&_other_details.md)

This document outlines the main objectives of the analysis and the specific key performance indicators (KPIs) to track.

## 4. Workflow Summary
The project workflow followed these steps:

1. **Dataset Collection and Problem Understanding**: 
   - Collected the dataset and thoroughly understood the problem statement and requirements.

2. **Data Querying Using MS SQL Server**:
   - Used SQL queries in MS SQL Server to extract key performance indicators (KPIs) and other relevant data.
   - All SQL queries used in this project are available in the following files:
     - [SQL Queries MD file](SQL_queries.md)
     - [SQL Queries Document (Word)](SQL_work/SQL_Query_Doc.docx)
     - [SQL Queries Script (SQL File)](SQL_work/SQL_Queries.sql)
   
3. **Power BI Dashboard Creation**:
   - Cleaned and transformed the data by connecting to the MS SQL Server.
   - Created a 3-page navigated Power BI dashboard to visualize and present the KPIs.
   - The 3-page dashboard includes:

     - ![Alt Text](images-videos/Details_Dashbaord.png)

4. **Dashboard Interactivity Recording**:
   - Recorded the interactive features of the Power BI dashboard.
